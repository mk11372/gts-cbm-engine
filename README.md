# Robotics Condition-Based Maintenance Engine

Condition-based maintenance engine that monitors robotic asset data in order to open service calls in an external CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System) when assets require maintenance. The goal of the above process is threefold: 
1) To improve system availability metrics of the robotic portion of the micro-fulfillment operation by reducing asset downtime caused by maintenance activities. 
2) To keep the labor and material costs of asset maintenance to a minimum by introducing a data-driven, only-when-needed approach to all non-corrective maintenance tasks.
3) To reduce the cognitive load on service engineering department heads managing maintenance and personnel schedules for a growing operation that's increasingly asset-intensive and spans two continents.
